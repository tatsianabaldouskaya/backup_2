In the dark,
And I’m right on the middle mark
I’m just in the tier of everything
That rides below the surface

And I watch
From a distance seventeen
And I’m short of the others' dreams
Of being golden and on top

It’s not
What you painted in my head
There’s so much there instead
Of all the colors that I saw

We all are living in a dream
But life ain’t what it seems
Oh everything’s a mess

And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything’s a mess

But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream

In the eyes
Of a teenage crystallized
Oh, the prettiest of lights
That hang the hallways of the home

And the cries
From the strangers out at night
They don’t keep us up at night
We have the curtains drawn and closed

We all are living in a dream
But life ain’t what it seems
Oh everything’s a mess

And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything’s a mess

But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream
